# Evaluating Sampling Techniques on Various Machine Learning Models for Addressing an Imbalanced Dataset
It is difficult for machine learning models to learn from highly imbalanced datasets as they are biased towards the majority class due to optimising overall accuracy. Changing class distributions through popular sampling techniques are common methods to balance the data. Thus, our goal is to review the various sampling methods to improve classification performances.
